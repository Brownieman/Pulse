ls -lh build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk

# Build for Play Store (app bundle)
flutter build appbundle --release

# Check bundle size
ls -lh build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab

# Test on real device
adb install -r build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk

## 🔄 STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION

### Quick Start (30 minutes)

**Step 1:** Search for Google Fonts in codebase
```bash
grep -r "fontFamily:" lib/ --include="*.dart"
grep -r "google_fonts" lib/ --include="*.dart"
```

**Step 2:** Replace with Theme defaults
```dart
// Before
TextStyle(
  fontFamily: 'Space Grotesk',
  fontSize: 32,
  fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
)

// After
Theme.of(context).textTheme.headlineLarge?.copyWith(
  fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
)
```

**Step 3:** Clean and reinstall
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

**Step 4:** Build and verify
```bash
flutter build apk --release
ls -lh build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

**Step 5:** Test app
- Run on device
- Test all features
- Verify size is 35-40 MB

## 📞 TROUBLESHOOTING

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Build fails after changes** | Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get` |
| **"Package not found" error** | The package was removed; use system alternatives |
| **App crashes on startup** | Check ProGuard rules for excluded classes |
| **Fonts look wrong** | Use `Theme.of(context).textTheme` instead |
| **App size still 50+ MB** | Verify ProGuard is enabled in build.gradle.kts |
| **Import errors** | Remove all imports from removed packages |
